    <!--                                           INTERNAL REFRENCE   
     Semantic Html element is an element that clearly describes its meaning both to the browser and developers by its name.
     EG:
     <header>: represent the header of page
        <nav>: represents a navigation links
        <section>: represents a standalone section of content
            
  
                Note:  By putting section with id we have created destination for each of the link we want to create .<section id"">
-->

    <!-- Scroll up you will find the nav function -->

    <section id="Radha">
        <h> Learn About Radha</h>
        <p> She is an eternal and internal potency of Krishna
            <br> Radharani always wants to make krishna happy because she is the internal energy(prakriti) of Krishna
            <br> she had a golden complextion
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Krishna">
        <h> Learn About Krishna</h>
        <p> Krishna is a Adipurusha
            <br> He is the only supreme enjoyer of all this creation and always wants to enjoy with his internal potency
            i.e Radharani
            <br> He had a dark bluish complextion
        </p>

<!-- 
The <header>, <main>, and <footer> elements in HTML are semantic elements. 
    <header>	For top navigation and intro content
    <main>	To highlight the central and unique content
    <footer>	For closing info, credits, or extra links at the bottom   
    Using these tags makes code easier to understand and maintain, and also helps search engines and screen readers understand the layout and importance of content.
